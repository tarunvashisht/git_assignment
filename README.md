    > a. What is an _issue_?
    Issues serve as a means of communication and collaboration among team members, allowing them to discuss and organize work items, report bugs, suggest enhancements, or outline tasks to be completed. They often include details such as a title, description, labels for categorization, assignees responsible for addressing the issue, milestones for tracking progress, and comments for discussing the issue further.

    A pull request (often abbreviated as "PR") is a feature in distributed version control systems like Git that facilitates collaboration and code review in a team environment, especially in open-source projects and large development teams.
